# 🛡️ AI-Powered Scam URL Detection System  
Real-Time Browser Extension + AI Risk Engine + Web-Based Scanner

A real-time, AI-assisted **browser-level fraud prevention system** that detects phishing, scam, and fake financial websites **before users enter sensitive information**.

Built with a **security-first architecture** combining:
- Rule-based detection
- Semantic HTML analysis
- AI intent analysis (Gemini, fallback-safe)
- Trusted infrastructure overrides
- Browser automation via Chrome Extension

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project proactively protects users from online financial fraud by:
- Detecting scam websites in real time
- Analyzing URLs, HTML structure, and page intent
- Preventing false positives on legitimate banking domains
- Running fully on the **client + local backend**
- Working even when AI services fail or are rate-limited

The system is designed to **alert users before entering UPI PINs, OTPs, passwords, or personal data**, addressing a major gap in current fraud detection systems.

## 🔍 Detection Pipeline

### URL Analysis
- HTTPS enforcement
- IP-based URLs
- Suspicious TLDs (`.xyz`, `.tk`, `.zip`, etc.)
- Trusted TLD override (`.bank.in`, `.gov.in`, `.edu.in`)

### HTML & Intent Analysis
- Sensitive input fields (PIN, OTP, PAN, Card)
- Social-engineering phrases
- Urgency-based buttons
- Suspicious form actions
- Title-based deception detection

### AI Semantic Analysis
- Detects phishing & scam intent
- Evaluates legitimacy conservatively
- Never overrides trusted infrastructure
- Safe fallback when AI is unavailable

### Risk Scoring Engine
- Rule-based scoring (low confidence)
- AI-assisted escalation
- Final verdict computation

---

## 🔒 Security-First Design Principles

- AI is advisory, not authoritative
- Trusted financial domains cannot be downgraded
- Fallback logic prevents AI hallucination errors
- Zero trust for unknown infrastructure
- No sensitive user data is stored or logged

---

## ⚙️ Caching & Performance

TTL-Based In-Memory Cache  
Cache Key → URL  
Value → (analysis result, timestamp)  

Cache duration: **12 hours**  
Expired entries are automatically invalidated.

---

## 🧪 Testing Framework

Offline HTML Test Suite:
- Legitimate websites
- Fake phishing pages
- SBI / Paytm clones
- OTP & UPI scam simulations

Batch Test Runner:
- Categorized results (LEGIT / FAKE)
- Automated verdict comparison
- False-positive detection
- Mismatch reporting
- Judge-friendly console output
